# Task 06 – Deep Fake Interview 

## Overview
This project was completed as part of **Research Task 6: Deep Fake**.  
The goal was to transform a statistical narrative from the Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse 2025 season (analyzed in Task 5) into an **AI-generated “deep fake” interview**.

The end product is an **audio/video-style interview** where a reporter asks players and the coach about their season performance, with answers generated from Task 5 data analysis.

---

## Objectives
- Convert the **Task 5 narrative (descriptive statistics)** into a conversational **Q&A script**.
- Use **AI tools** to generate realistic voices for players, coach, and reporter.
- Assemble the responses into a short interview-style audio/video.

## Process

### 1. Script Creation
- Reviewed results from **Task 5 (Descriptive Statistics and LLM Validation)**:
  - Top scorer: Emma Muchnick (34 goals)  
  - Most assists & points: Emma Ward (46 assists, 76 points)  
  - Most clutch: Caroline Trinkaus (4 game-winning goals)  
  - Efficiency leader: Sam DeVito (67% shooting)  
  - Team totals: 234 goals, 112 assists, 346 points  
  - Defensive impact: Joely Caramelli, etc.  
- Converted each data point into a **Q&A interview script**:
  - Reporter asks → Player/Coach responds.
  - Script covered **all 11 statistical questions (A–K)**.

### 2. Voice Generation
- Used NotebookLM to generate voices:
  - **Reporter**: neutral, energetic voice.  
  - **Coach**: authoritative tone.  

### 3. Assembly
- Combined generated voice clips into one continuous **interview audio/video**.  

### 4. Final Product

## Challenges
- Aligning **data-driven stats** with **natural conversational answers**.  
- Tool limitations (free tiers restrict length/voice options).  
- Balancing **realism** vs. **time/technical constraints**.  

---

## Reflection
This project showed how to move beyond static analysis into **storytelling with data**.  
By turning numbers into dialogue, the stats became more **engaging and memorable**.  
It also provided hands-on experience with **AI voice synthesis and basic media editing**, bridging quantitative research and creative communication.
